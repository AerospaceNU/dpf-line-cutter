# Summary
This document explains how to offload data from the line cutters' flash memory. It will also go over proper folder organization for commits of data to the repository.

# Setup
You should already have a local version of this repo as part of the general preparation for a line cutter flight. In addition, download [CoolTerm](https://freeware.the-meiers.org/), which will be used to save data from the Arduino serial monitor.
